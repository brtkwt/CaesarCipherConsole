<h1>CaesarCipherConsole</h1>

This simple console application is designed for encoding passwords stored on paper. The cipher isn't complex, it is used just as a precaution for nosy siblings.
It works just as Caesar Cipher with one exception. The shift parameter is encoded as a character and stored at a set location within the plain text. As a result, it doesn't have to be remembered separately. The password can also be decrypted without the app.

The location pattern of the encoded shift character can be easily modified to be less obvious and more difficult to decrypt.

This app is an updated replica of the original version created in 2018, which was unfortunately lost due to a hard drive failure. It was my first hobby project when I just started coding, initially written in C++ and later adapted to C and C#. There were many iterations of this app, with each successive version being simpler and shorter.
