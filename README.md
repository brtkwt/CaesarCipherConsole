<h1>CaesarCipherConsole</h1>

This simple console application is designed for encoding passwords stored on paper. The cipher used isn't complex, it was developed just as a precaution to prevent unwanted attention. 
It works just as Caesar Cipher with one exception. The shift parameter is encoded as a character and stored at a set location within the plain text. Because of that passwords are posible to decrypt without the app.

This app is a replica of the original version created in 2018, which was unfortunately lost due to a hard drive failure. It was my first hobby project, initially written in C++ and later adapted to C and C#.
